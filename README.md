# Databaze_functions

### Structure
Second project databaze written in c++. There are **six** functions for work with information about people.

### Possibilities
The program can read data from file, output data to the consol, edit someone's data, delete someone's data, add data and save data to file.

### Efficiency
This program isn't effective because it almost every time recreates variables and overwrites data to files.
However it's an interesting idea to make databaze using functions.
